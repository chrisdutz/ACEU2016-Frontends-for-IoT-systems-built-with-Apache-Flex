* Open-Source enthusiast

== Agenda

image::rapiro.png[float=right]

* What do we need?
* What parts of Apache Flex can help?
* Why is Flex so great for IoT?
* Demo

== What do we need?

* Server application a client can talk to
* Client that talks to the server
* Logic on the server that talks to the IoT hard/software

== What parts of Apache Flex can help?

* BlazeDS as communication endpoint to any client
* Flex client as frontend

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Actually the IoC Code is the only part that we have to implement
But we're thinking of a BlazeDS MQTT Messaging Adapter to link Flex Messaging and MQTT together

== Why is Flex so great for IoT?

=== On the Server

image::spring-boot-logo.png[float=right]

* BlazeDS-Spring-Boot-Starter
** Automatically configures the BlazeDS server
** Using Spring-Flex for configuring the details
** Activated by providing a "META-INF/flex/services-config.xml"

=== On the Server

image::blazeds-logo.jpg[float=right]

* BlazeDS
** Server-Push
** Remoting (call method on server)
** Messaging (JMS-Like publish-subscribe)
*** JMS integration possible
** Automatic serialization/deserialization
** Strongly typed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Server-Push with graceful downgrade to long-polling and normal (short) polling
* Full JMS integration easily configurable
--

=== On the Server

* Spring-Flex
** Make Spring bean accessible by annotating with @RemotingDestination
** Takes care of configuring BlazeDS for Spring
** Integrates BlazeDS into Spring
*** Spring Messaging
*** Spring Security
*** ...

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Spring-Messaging or default ActionScript Messaging
--

=== On the client

* Strongly typed model
* Client-Side model auto-generated from server model
* Framework handles the communication details automatically
* Deployable as native application on Android and IOs devices
* Skinning

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* As the client model is generated from the server model they are always in sync
* Also deployable on Windows, Mac, Linux as native applications or on any platform with Adobe Air runtime
* Also runable on Browsers, if Flash is enabled.

== Client-Server Communication Example

=== On the Server

[source,java]
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/codecentric/iot/rapiro/movement/MovementService.java[]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Scroll down the code to see the rest.
--

=== On the client

* Declaration of the remote service incl. methods and callbacks

[source,java]
----
include::{flexsourcedir}/de/codecentric/iot/rapiro/Application.mxml[lines=7..13]
----

=== On the client

* Calling the remote methods
[source,java]
----
include::{flexsourcedir}/de/codecentric/iot/rapiro/Application.mxml[lines=62]
----
[source,java]
----
include::{flexsourcedir}/de/codecentric/iot/rapiro/Application.mxml[lines=52..54]

== Skinning Example

* Component + Skin
* Component = functional implementation of control
* Skin = visual representation (incl. UI logic)
* Not only for positioning as with CSS in JS/HTML
* Different usability on touch and desktop

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Skin usually contains the logic for all UI-related operations
* Component relieved of any non-functional logic
* Big form on desktop, wizard on mobile

// TODO: Implement this ...

== Demo of the Robot

=== Hardware Details

* Arduino Uno handling the Movement
* Pixy (CMUcam5) handling processing of the image data
* IR Distance sensor
* Raspberry PI 3 communicating with all of the sub-systems
** 64 bit Quad Core ARM Cortex-A53
** WiFi access point, 32GB SD flash memory, 1GB Ram
* PAM8403 based audio amplifier

=== Software Details

// TODO: Check the details ...
* OS: Raspbian
* OpenJDK 1.8
* Jetty-based Spring-Boot application
* BlazeDS
* Akka
